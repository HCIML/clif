# Main Page {#mainpage}

CLIF is a file format and corresponding library based on hdf5, to simplify light field handling and implement basic processing.

# Documentation Overview

Documentation is grouped into three parts:
- [Library Documentation](@ref clif)
- [File Format](\ref file_format)
- [Tools and File Handling](\ref tools)

If documentation was not built together with the library, it may be directly accessed through the \c doc/ directory and the included library headers
